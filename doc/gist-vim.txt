TIPS                                                           |gist-vim-tips|

If you set {g:gist_clip_command}, gist.vim will copy the gist code with option
"-c".

  - Mac: >
    let g:gist_clip_command = 'pbcopy'
<
  - Linux: >
    let g:gist_clip_command = 'xclip -selection clipboard'
<
  - Others (cygwin?): >
    let g:gist_clip_command = 'putclip'
<

If you want to detect filetype from the filename: >

    let g:gist_detect_filetype = 1
<
If you want to open the browser after the post: >

    let g:gist_open_browser_after_post = 1
<
If you want to change the browser: >

    let g:gist_browser_command = 'w3m %URL%'
<
or: >

    let g:gist_browser_command = 'opera %URL% &'
<
On windows, this should work with your user settings.

If you want to show your private gists with ":Gist -l": >

    let g:gist_show_privates = 1
<
If you get problems when creating gists try: >

	:Gist --abandon
